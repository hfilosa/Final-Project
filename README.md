# Final-Project
Henry, Greg and Isaac's final project

We set out in this project to try and replicate the online game superhotline miami, which can be played here: http://albatr.itch.io/superhotline-miami. 
None of us have any experience with graphical coding so we decided to use Processing to code the game. We also have no experience with Processing, so that was a learning experience. 

One of our biggest challenges when coding the game was managing enemy movement. We originally tried to implement an A* algorithm, but after finding that too computationally intensive with our implementation we instead used a simple heuristic that produced the desired behavior with minimal pathfinding errors.

Our latest version 11-13.2 has random generation of the playing field and the enemy. We have bullets and their motion implemented for the player. 

Working on this final project we gained the valuable experience of teaching ourselves how to code and navigate in a variant language and IDE.
